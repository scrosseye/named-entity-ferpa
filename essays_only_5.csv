1,"Images and impressions have a negative effects on people. This is because when people see things that look appealing it gives them an urge to buy it, even if it is trash. Images have made it easier to fool people, and get away with it. You can see this in the food industry a lot. They will show an image of a delicious hamburger, cooked to perfection, with a perfectly round bun, juicy tomato, fresh lettuce, and to top it all off, ketchup and mustard. Then when you get your food, it looks like they took the picture and ran it over with a car. This type of deceiving is unfair, and should not be allowed. Sometimes people can do impressions of a person that makes you think that they are an awful person, such as when the news said that Ellen was cheating on her wife, they even had pictures, that were later proven to be falsified. This was not true, of course, but many people stopped watching her show because of what they heard. Even though some places and people do use images for positive reasons, the majority of people seem to use these things for their own personal gain, or to ruin someone's reputation, and because of this, images and impressions have a negative effect on us, and our society. Images and impressions can be used for positive or negative reasons, however the trend is to use them for negative reasons, which makes them dangerous.

2,"People are very intune to trying to make lastly empression all the time. Whether it be on the job, movie productions, or simply in a class setting. having a postive image is always the goal. All around the world, people are always trying to provide this impression on people that everything is going good in their life and how they can complain. This may be the case but we also have people that fake their images and not want to show what really is going on with them. it makes people wonder if images and impressions show a positive or a negative effect on people.

Positive can be a hit or miss situation. There are people out there who actually show they are genuinely living a positive lifestyle. They are more open in accepting people and their criticism that they have to input. Positive impressions make people want to talk to you and get to know the things that you have to offer. The downside it is all is negative impressions. This can be very tricky in terms of that people can hide their negative impressions by making things positive. the truth uusally always comes out and it never really pretty. it makes the person more sad and depressed becasue they are not trying to face the reality that is happening to them. It simply changes the person. 

Some people are so worried about being someone that their not. They want that ongoing attention becasue that is what they feed off of. Everything simply has to be perfect for them but life is truly not perfect. People make mistakes and try to fix it and move on. That is what makes their image more positive than negative. Always wanting approval from others and not considering what is truly important is what makes people lost and give off negative impressions. The underlying question is it is negative ot positive on the person? It can really go either way because the person sets their impressions in how people want to view them as. Everyone is entitled to shoe case who they really are, even if its the right way or not.

3,"Imagine walking through the mall. You in the midst of your holiday shopping and everywhere you look there are products being advertised to you everywhere. To your left you see a poster for Victoria Secret with models with flawless skin and unealistic body figures. To your right you see a huge projected image of Kendell Jenner laughing as if she's having the best time of her life while holding a tiny can of Pepsi. You try to escape the consistant advertisements in your face, so you go to the food court. Unfortunately, there are pictures of perfectly swirled ice cream cones, but as you see one being made, it looks nothing like the picture. This is what we are exposed to every single day, and often times, we don't really notice it because it's become second nature to us. Images and impressions are everywere, and they really do have huge influences on people. The debate is, however, are these effects positive or negative. All in all, it depends on the product or person being shown, their intention, and their delivery. Many times though, people are blinded by how much profit they can make from these things, or how much fame it can get them. This leads to a toxic effect on their audience as this causes a rushed and ingenuine delivery of their image. This is extremely dangerous for our children when they are exposed to these certain images and impressions. They are just kids and don't understand how to analyze certain things that they see on television or in stores. And with the combination of this and the poor message and delivery of certain images, it gets engraved into the children's minds, which can have negative effects on them. These faulty images or personas are especially evident in celebrities. For example, the Kardashians have grown very popular and wealthy because of their image that they show in their television show and on social media. Many people argue that the Kardashians are famous for no reason because they have no talents to be famous for. However, this is our own fault. As a society, we have let these certain personas take a negative toll on how we view people which inturn, has allowed the Kardashians to become so famous. Not only does this happen with celebrities, but it happens in our own towns. With social media becoming an even bigger part of our lives, we see these things happen on our social media feeds with our friends and family. With social media, many people only show the good times in their live. This causes people to compare their own lives to their friend's perfect lives. This can have very negative efects on people both emotionally

4,"Images have a negative effect on people. People like what they see and they project what they would like their lives to be onto other people. At this day and age people are bored with their average lives and the same old 9-5 jobs so if Kendall Jenner says she uses bleach instead of chlorine then people will buy bleach. If they can just get a taste of the reality that they are even 1/8 living the life of someone who's life is their eyes is amazing they will do it. It's truly sad that people have to base their lives of celebrities and influners because anybody can make their lives seem perfect when you only see two seconds of it. People are in in love with a fascade and if they could open their eyes and realize it then maybe they could see how far more important their lives are. 

Color sells belive it or not. I would rather buy a cute cleaning product that barely works comapared to a dull looking cleaning product that works fantatic frankly people one looks better than the other. Does that make sense? Not really but that is captalism for you. Though it does sound shallow I don't think it's a problem to judge a book by it's cover in certain cases. Just make the product that works better look better. It's a win win situation.

5,"Appearances are the new reality in our current times. We tend to believe what we see and never seem to doubt it because we feel as if there is nothing to doubt. This is not the case, and in fact, images are known to have a negative effect on people. These false appearances that products and people can give off gives us a wrapped view of life.

A false appearance that is meant to be taken as reality can distort how we view ourselves and how we view the world. A prime example of this is our current day social media where everyone posts pictures that make them look too happy and almost too perfect. The nice white smile, the perfect body or face, and somehow the lighting is always just right. This isn't reality though. Reality isn't always this nice. We don't always look this good. We aren't always this happy, yet we want the world to people that we are. If we scroll through social media with the mindset that what we see is someone's real life, then we start reflecting on our own. We can start to feel upset at how our lives aren't perfect or how we aren't great at everything. There have been studies done that have shown a correlation between higher social media usage and self esteem, and the link shows that higher usage equates to lower self esteem. This is because you are seeing exactly what you want and comparing yourself because you don't have it. This is especially true with celebrities. They will show their designer clothes, brand new cars and houses, and even their hard cash. The average person doesn't have that, but we would love if we did. What we don't know as the average person is what isn't perfect about that celebrities life. They could be going through trauma from a familial death or battling mental illness, and we wouldn't know based off the appearance they show us. Another example of how appearance can shape how we view the world is with politicians. Politicians that are currently in office only tend to talk about how what they have done has made their country a better place, but will fail to mention all their wrongdoings. Politicians who want to be in office will make overextended promises to round up voters, but sometimes their promises either can't be done at all or would require too much money/man power the country simply doesn't have. All of these appearances end up negatively effecting people because people will end up not believing politicians, but they will start believing fake news that is spread on social media. This fake news only leads to the influx of more misinformation and fear mongering. Either way, people are hurt by the appearances politicians try to give off as reality. The last example is store advertising, from TV ads to what color the box is. TV ads are known for only telling you the great things about a product, but always fail to mention clearly the negative effects of that product. Medicine companies tend to do this frequently when they promote all the health benefits of a drug, but only quietly or very quickly explain the harmful side effect of the drug. People have the right to know the bad parts of the drugs just as much as the good parts. Colorful packages also have been marketed to taste better, look better, and just do more than packages with less colors or no colors at all. This isn't reality because sometimes store brands or generic brands will work just as well or taste just the same as some of the brands we know by heart.
